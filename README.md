# Meme-Sentimental-Analysis
Meme Sentiment Analysis is a project that understands the emotion in memes by reading both the image and the text in it. It uses OCR to extract the text and deep learning to analyze the picture. The system then classifies the meme as positive, negative, neutral, or funny.
